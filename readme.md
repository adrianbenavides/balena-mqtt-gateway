This project is a customized version of the [awesome BalenaSense](https://github.com/balena-io-projects/balena-sense) with the difference that this is not attached to any sensor, it just handles incoming MQTT messages and stores them in the database.

This setup is really helpful if you want to work with a bunch of microcontrollers with WiFi, like the ESP8266, each one measuring different metrics in different places within the WiFi range.
